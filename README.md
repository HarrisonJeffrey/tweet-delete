# Tweet-Delete | 2020 Vision
Just a simple app that allows a user to upload their twitter archive data and selectively delete any/all of their tweets.

### Features
* Delete all of a users tweets
* Filter by month and delete selected
* Show tweets containing words listed in Google's profanity filter


#### NOTE
This will not run as is! This will be separately packaged in due course, however if you would like the run the script yourself then please install the requirements listed in *requirements.txt*. You will also need to create a .env file that contains consumer access tokens (you will need to register an app with Twitter) in the following format:-

consumer_key=YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY_HERE

consumer_secret=YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET_KEY_HERE
